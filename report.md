# #4 Comparative Analysis of Binary Search Trees and Red-Black Trees

## Introduction
This report presents a comparative analysis between a standard Binary Search Tree (BST) and a Red-Black Tree (RBT), focusing on their performance in insertion, search, and deletion operations. The study examines both skewed and non-skewed data across different sizes to evaluate the operational efficiency and structural properties of these tree types.

## Methodology
### Experimental Setup
- **Trees Analyzed**: Standard BST and RBT.
- **Data Sets**: Skewed and non-skewed data across sizes (200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200).
- **Operations Measured**: Insertion, search, and deletion.
- **Performance Metrics**: Average time taken for operations, average height of the trees.
- **Tools Used**: Execution timers to measure operation times accurately.

### Data Generation
- **Skewed Data**: Generated by inserting nodes in a specific order to simulate real-world uneven data distribution.
- **Non-Skewed Data**: Randomly generated to ensure an even distribution.

## Results and Analysis
### Skewed Data
#### Insertion Time and Height
- **BST**: Exhibited a linear increase in insertion time and height, indicating a tendency towards a linked-list structure.
- **RBT**: Demonstrated low insertion time and logarithmic height growth, showcasing its self-balancing nature.

#### Search and Deletion Time
- **BST**: Increased linearly with data size, reflecting inefficiency in skewed data handling.
- **RBT**: Significantly lower times for both operations due to its balanced structure.

### Non-Skewed Data
#### Insertion Time and Height
- **BST and RBT**: Comparable insertion times; however, RBT maintained a lower average height.

#### Search and Deletion Time
- **BST and RBT**: Similar performance, indicating that tree balancing has less impact with evenly distributed data.

## Comparative Insights
- **Skewed Data Handling**: RBT's self-balancing properties provide faster operations and structural advantages over BST in skewed scenarios.
- **Non-Skewed Data**: While operational times are similar, RBT's consistently balanced structure offers reliability in varied data scenarios.

## Conclusion
The analysis emphasizes the importance of tree balancing in data structures, especially in skewed data scenarios. While BSTs perform adequately with non-skewed data, their efficiency diminishes with skewed data. RBTs, with their inherent balancing, ensure more consistent and efficient performance across different data distributions.

# #6 # Hash Function Analysis for Vehicle Registration

## Introduction
This section analyzes the effectiveness of a hash function used in a hash table for storing vehicle information, focusing on registration numbers. The study evaluates conflict frequencies in relation to table capacities and vehicle counts.

## Methodology
### Experimental Setup
- **Hash Table Capacities**: Evaluated at 10, 20, 40, 80, 160.
- **Vehicle Counts**: 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 vehicles.
- **Metrics Measured**:
  - Average Initial Conflicts: Conflicts before probing.
  - Average Probing Conflicts: Conflicts during probing.
  - Average Total Conflicts: Sum of initial and probing conflicts.

### Hash Function
- **Function Design**: Based on vehicle registration numbers.
- **Probing Strategy**: Specific strategy used for resolving conflicts (e.g., quadratic probing).

## Results and Analysis
### Impact of Table Capacity on Conflicts
- **Lower Capacities (10, 20)**: High total conflicts, indicating insufficient capacity for larger datasets.
- **Medium Capacities (40, 80)**: Reduced total conflicts, suggesting better hash value distribution.
- **Higher Capacity (160)**: Most efficient in managing conflicts, highlighting the benefits of larger capacities.

### Impact of Vehicle Count on Conflicts
- **Increasing Vehicle Count**: Consistent rise in conflicts across all capacities, emphasizing the effect of dataset size on hash function efficiency.

### Hash Function Efficiency
- **Initial Conflicts**: Generally lower at higher capacities, indicating more effective data distribution.
- **Probing Conflicts**: Varied pattern, generally lower at higher capacities, stressing the importance of the probing mechanism.

## Comparative Insights
- **Table Capacity vs. Dataset Size**: Higher capacities reduce conflicts, improving hash table performance. The hash function distributes data more evenly with larger spaces.
- **Probing Strategy**: An efficient probing strategy is crucial in managing conflicts, especially with larger datasets.

## Conclusion
The hash function for vehicle registration numbers demonstrates varying effectiveness based on table capacity and vehicle count. Optimal performance is achieved with higher capacities, which reduce conflicts. This study provides insights into designing efficient hash tables with effective conflict resolution mechanisms, particularly for large datasets like vehicle registrations.
